        <h1>Kaskazini-Band</h1>
        <p>Kaskazini is a vibrant Kenyan urban-fusion trio formed in Nairobi by Eugine Ywaya (Vocals/ guitar), Israel Onyach (vocals/ bass/ guitar) and Chris Clave (vocals/ guitar/ keyboard).
            The three friends pursued music individually until they reconnected at the Sauti Academy where they sharpened their vocal techniques, song writing skills, music knowledge and later graduated in April 2017 which marked thier official entry into the Kenyan music industry boy band trio.
            They are currently working on their album.
            Kaskazini are well known for their heartfelt lyrics and distinctive harmonies.
            Their music is based off rich aquistic guitar riffs and catchy soulful melodies inspired by a afro-fusion inspired by rhythms infused with r&b and soul undertones.
            I like their music because they are refreshing and soothing while their lyrics are heart felt and conjures up nonstalgic feelings.
